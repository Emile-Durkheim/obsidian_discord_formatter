# Discord Message Formatter for Obsidian.md
Just **CTRL+C** from the desktop Discord client and CTRL+V into Obsidian! All the formatting will be done for you; no more scrambled messages! :)

### Limitations

The plugin relies on HTML that Discord **usually** serves when you copy a message **via CTRL+C** from the Desktop Client. However, **Discord does not do this reliably**. In 10% of cases, your clipboard contains only raw text, which the plugin can't parse. So you'll have to select the message slightly differently and then try again!

**Desktop only, CTRL+C only**: If you try to copy the text out of anything but the Desktop client using the CTRL+C shortcut, your clipboard will only contain raw text which the plugin cannot parse.

### Features
- Paste usernames, message times, message texts directly into your notes
- Paste whole conversations rather than just single messages
- Easy to use with just CTRL+C and CTRL+V
- Convert all Discord markdown to Obsidian markdown (underline, bold, quotes, strikethrough, etc.)
- Embed attachments/website in Obsidian
